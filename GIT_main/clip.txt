The player guessing the word may, at any time, attempt to guess the whole word.
If the word is correct, the game is over and the guesser wins.
Otherwise, the other player may choose to penalize the guesser by adding an element to the diagram.
On the other hand, if the guesser makes enough incorrect guesses to allow the other player to complete
 the diagram, the guesser loses. However, 
the guesser can also win by guessing all the letters that appear in the word, 
thereby completing the word, before the diagram is completed.
